# GAN-Project-Project-Code-
A machine learning project for the Fall 2022 semester of Project Code, a student organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <br>
This project was meant to get students with limited experience in machine learning up to speed with core concepts of neural networks, especially Generative Adversarial Networks, and have them build a GAN with convolutional layers from scratch using the PyTorch library.
